# Hysch: Technical Solution for Managing High Sounds in Study Environments

High sounds in study environments can negatively impact many individuals. This report presents a technical solution called "Hysch" to prevent high sounds using Arduino MKR, a MKR connector carrier, a microphone, and a speaker.

## Components Used
- Arduino MKR
- MKR connector carrier
- Microphone
- Speaker

## Functionality
The Arduino MKR is programmed to activate the speaker when the ambient sound exceeds a certain threshold. This helps in alerting individuals to lower the noise level.

## Connectivity
The Arduino is connected to Wi-Fi using Arduino IoT Cloud. This allows users to monitor the sound level remotely by connecting to the Wi-Fi network.

## Possible Improvements
- Changing the speaker beep to a softer sound or a light indicator for less intrusive alerts.
- Implementing additional features for better sound management.

## Conclusion
The "Hysch" serves as a useful tool for maintaining sound levels in study environments. However, there is much room for improvement to enhance its functionality and user experience.
